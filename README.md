# Solutions to Programming Principles and Practice Using C++, 2nd Edition
# Bjarne Stroustrup (solutions by LachlanMarnham)

I like to solve textbook problems for fun. I am providing them for public consumption under the assumption that they will be
used by people to complement self-study. They are not intended for use by school/university students who were assigned
problems from the textbook by an instructor. If you are a school/university student who was assigned problems from the
textbook by an instructor, and have found your way here with a mind to copy my solutions: 1) please don't do that, and
2) consider asking your instructor to assign their own problems so your peers can't do it either.


These will rarely present the optimal solution to the given problem. Instead, I always stick to the paradigm of only using bits 
of the language which have been covered to the point in the textbook where the exercise appears. This can be annoying sometimes, 
because there is often a very elegant way to solve a problem which I'm forced to avoid because it's covered in a later chapter. 
On the other hand, I have found that forcing myself to solve problems in the 'beginner' way from time to time occasionally prevents 
me from slipping into the mindset of trying to over-engineer everything in the real world. Also, this is the only realistic way to 
publish solutions which can be understood by anybody who is following along with the textbook.


I'm not going to bother writing up the drills and reviews as they rarely involve any code, but they are handy to read through and 
answer briefly in your head.


I've answered all of the exercises), with the exception with of those which are sub-trivial AND involve no code. A list of such 
exercises can be found in SKIPPED.md.


### All solutions were tested against g++ 7.2.0
